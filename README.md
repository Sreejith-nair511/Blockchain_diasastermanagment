# 🔗 Algorand Simulator

**Algorand Simulator** is a modular, developer-focused tool designed to simulate the behavior of the Algorand blockchain consensus protocol. This simulator helps researchers, developers, and students gain deep insights into how Algorand nodes communicate, validate, and reach consensus in a secure and efficient way.

> 🧩 This project is part of a larger suite of blockchain protocol tools designed to support the development, testing, and education of decentralized systems.

---

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Simulation of Algorand’s Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) mechanism
- ⛓️ Emulation of node behavior (block creation, propagation, validation)
- 🔄 Support for multi-node, round-based consensus simulation
- 📊 Logging and visual feedback for each simulation round
- 🛠️ Configurable parameters: number of nodes, transaction frequency, round length, etc.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone or Download
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/algorand-simulator.git
cd algorand-simulator
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. Then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Simulator
